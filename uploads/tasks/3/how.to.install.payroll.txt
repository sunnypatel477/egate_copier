summary:

when uploading to git, only code will get uploaded


when we download code from github, it will automatically download the packages
but we need to do this additioanl steps:

this is from original code (not from git)
inside packges folder: there might be _custom folder and TrialMaker library

(after downlaoding from git)
so need to replace this manually to github downloaded.



do you understand?yes
80%


i can revise again



step 1: goto github repo
step 2: goto release section
step 3: download reuiqred files (eg: data, custompackage) and even source code zip
step 4: unzip source file and open with vs
step 5: just open with visual studio and wait for the packages folder to create automatically (maybe check after 2mins)
step 6: after packages folder is visible unzip the custompackage.zip inside packges folder
spte 7: you should see _custom and TrialMaker.Library folder
step 8: open .sln file with vs and build and run

i think this is it ok wait
